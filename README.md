Example WWW site using decaf
============================
This tutorial will walk you through using bower to install the prerequisites for serving dynamic content via HTTP with decafjs.

## Bower

For the purposes of this tutorial, it is assumed you've installed bower from its homepage: http://bower.io.  You can also search for packages you can install with bower here: http://bower.io/search/.  Note that decaf and the modules specifically written for it do not show up in bower search YET.

The first thing we need to do is to create a bower.json file in the root of the project.  You can use

    $ bower init

to create the initial bower.json file, or you can create it from scratch - we'll create ours from scratch here.
